Instructions:

    To add the venn diagram to a question in Qualtrics:
    
    1. Create a new question. Change the question's item type to 'Text Entry' -> 'Single Line'.
    
    2. Set a Validation Type of 'Content Validation' to the question, and select 'Number', with a min value of 0, max value of 100, and max decimals of 0.
       
    3. Edit the Questions text, and select the HTML View (for instructions, see: http://www.qualtrics.com/university/researchsuite/coders-corner/html-and-css). 
       
    4. Edit venn.html to change the variable names that you want to use for the Venn diagram circles. Replace the values in this text at the top of venn.html with your own values.
           var LeftCircleText = "Your Value Left";
           var RightCircleText = "Your Value Right";
           
    5. Paste the contents of venn.html into the HTML view of your question. Type any question text above the pasted contents of venn.html.

        For multiple questions, simply repeat steps 1 -5.
